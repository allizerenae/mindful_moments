# mindful_moments
A console application that promotes self-care
As a mom with ADHD who practices yoga every day, this app was created from a very personal place. Mindful Moments helps me stay grounded, regulated, and present. It’s designed with the needs of a neurodivergent mom in mind—someone who balances care for herself while being the seed of stability, calm, and growth for her family.
